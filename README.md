# IoT-Based Smart Security and Home Automation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based smart home security and automation system developed using Arduino and Wi-Fi module. The system monitors motion and door activity and sends real-time alerts using MQTT protocol. It also controls home appliances using relay modules through remote access.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Arduino / ESP8266
- MQTT Protocol
- Blynk Platform
- AWS Cloud
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Magnetic Door Sensor
- Relay Module
- Embedded C
- Wi-Fi Communication

## ⚙ Working Principle
1. PIR sensor detects human motion.
2. Door sensor detects open/close state.
3. Data is sent to MQTT broker via Wi-Fi.
4. Blynk dashboard displays real-time alerts.
5. Relay modules control appliances remotely.

## 🧠 System Architecture
Device → Wi-Fi → MQTT Broker → Cloud → Mobile App
